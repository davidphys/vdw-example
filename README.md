Van der Waals Force Example
===

Example of a leapfrog integrator for a van der waals force.

You can download a .zip file of this project, unzip it onto some directory in the imac, and type "make" to run all the commands in the file "makefile". This will compile the simulation, run the simulation, run the python file, and then run convert to make the output animation. "make clean" will delete all of the output files.
